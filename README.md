# HelloGo
Gophers gonna go

A little play with Golang to understand some of the basics.

To play with:
	nc 127.0.0.1 20000
		someId
		_echo HELLO

Of note to self
	...T variadic args
	v... arg expansion
	T is subtype of interface{}
		though not so for []interface{}
	array[:] is *array
	*testing.T <3
	godoc <3
